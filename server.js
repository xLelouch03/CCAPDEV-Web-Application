This oceanarium located at the heart of Manila is a haven for sea life enthusiasts. The Oceanarium, the park's main attraction, is a surreal spectacle. The walk-through tunnel with a 360-degree view is as close as you can get to the experience of being on the ocean floor. With diverse species of fish and marine creatures swimming overhead, it's a sight that leaves one in awe of the richness of marine biodiversity. The Trails to Antarctica section was another highlight. The Humboldt penguins are charming, and it's fascinating to observe them in their carefully simulated natural habitat. It's not every day you get to see penguins in Manila! Furthermore, the park's commitment to educating its visitors about marine conservation was commendable. The interactive exhibits and informational displays throughout the park provide valuable insights into the challenges facing our oceans today.",
